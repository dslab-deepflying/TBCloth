**Second experiment by fingerprint-cluster in week 2**

It seems a sweet way to combine fingerprint-cluster
and image-net model's prediction. Elecorto ( we mentioned 
before ) hashed the vgg16's prediction of a hacked rgb image
to a fingerprint data-set.And it works,with 8% uncluster image in total
5000 images sample. 
* VGG16 perform worse than vgg19 and res-net,we can use
these network 
* Use real gray-scale images other than simple hacked images
