#Image Classifier by imagenet
**First  Experiment in week 1**

<br>
We try combine the prediction of VGG16 and 
XCeption,by basic statistics,to
get a sound classification for clothes.But it
turn to be a mediocre classifier which has almost
50% wrong answer.

<br>

* ImageNet model may take a poor accuracy for normal cloth
* Combining the prediction loss to much information
* Alipay's data-sets is closer to show what they want rather
than emphasizing the attribute of this cloth

Through changing the model and combining method times,
their predictions ( items(v1).txt ~ items(v3).txt) still 
looking poorly .

<br>
Tools folder contain some script to deal with these
txt file for summing
